title: Continous Time Modeling - What, Why and How?
---

Myself, Rebecca Kuiper and Ellen Hamaker have recently completed work on a book chapter, providing a broad didactical treatment of the continuous-time (CT) first-order vector autoregressive (VAR(1)) model in the context of psychological research using intensive longitudinal (ESM) data. The pre-print of this book chapter is avaiable for download [here](https://ryanoisin.github.io/files/RyanKuiperHamaker_2018_chapter_preprint.pdf). 

In this chapter we describe the conceptual and practical differences between discrete-time and continous-time approaches, as well as discussing tools like impulse response functions, vector fields and lagged-parameter plots which can be used to interpret CT-VAR(1) models. 

To illustrate CT models we re-analyse a single-subject experience sampling dataset, published by Kossakowski et al. (2017) in the Journal of Open Psychology Data, available [here](https://osf.io/j4fg8/). The analysis was conducted with the *ctsem* package; R code for the analysis is included in the appendix, and can also be found on my [github page](https://github.com/ryanoisin/continuous_time-ILD-what-why-how), along with R-code for generating all of the figures in the chapter. 

This chapter is schedule to appear in print in 2018, in the book *Continuous time modeling in the behavioral and related sciences* edited by K. v. Montfort, J. H. L. Oud, & M. C. Voelkle.
